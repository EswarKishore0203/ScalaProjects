#The Oyster Card Problem
You are required to model the following fare card system which is a limited version of
London’s Oyster card system. At the end of the test, you should be able to demonstrate a
user loading a card with £30, and taking the following trips, and then viewing the balance.

-Tube Holborn to Earl’s Court

-328 bus from Earl’s Court to Chelsea

-Tube Earl’s court to Hammersmith
#Operation
When the user passes through the inward barrier at the station, their oyster card is charged
the maximum fare.
When they pass out of the barrier at the exit station, the fare is calculated and the maximum
fare transaction removed and replaced with the real transaction (in this way, if the user
doesn’t swipe out, they are charged the maximum fare).
